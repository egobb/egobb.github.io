## About Me

Hello, I am Enrique. I am a software engineer at [Imatia Innovation](https://www.imatia.com/), working with [Inditex](https://www.inditex.com/itxcomweb/es/es/home) on large-scale inventory 
management platform. My focus today is on high-demand backend engineering, designing and building microservices that process millions of events while meeting strict performance, reliability, and scalability requirements — all while leading my team with a strong functional perspective.
What defines me is being a hybrid profile: I bridge business 
requirements with technology, enabling teams and ensuring projects deliver real value.

### My Journey

Since I was a teenager, I knew I wanted to become a computer engineer. My degree at the [University of A Coruña](https://www.udc.es/) confirmed that decision and led me to explore the world of low-level programming and embedded systems, a focus I captured in my [Bachelor’s thesis](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WrdhfTrU4Ey2ytuP9didsABFV0ZPd8cK/view?usp=sharing) *“Energy Consumption Modeling for the Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 Processor”*. Shortly after, at [Telecon Galicia](https://telecongalicia.com/), I worked on embedded software for energy management devices, and it was there — almost by chance — that I first had to design a high-level backend platform to build a smart metering management PaaS. What began as necessity quickly turned into a genuine interest. Later, at [Bionix Technologies](https://www.linkedin.com/company/bionixsupplychaintechnologies/?originalSubdomain=es), I deepened this path by focusing on RFID platforms, directly tied to my [Master’s thesis]((https://drive.google.com/file/d/151UcWF2ceoW0Mq8scb0J0-OAJDNRPLb9/view?usp=sharing)) *“Inventory Traceability and Verification Across the Supply Chain Using RFID”*.

In 2020 I joined Imatia Innovation to work with Inditex, and it was here that my career truly took shape. I started on the company’s central inventory platform, initially a large monolithic solution. Within months I stepped up as proxy tech lead, coordinating the development team and guiding the platform both technically and functionally. This experience marked the beginning of my transition from being “just” a developer to becoming someone who also bridges business requirements with engineering execution.

Since 2023 I have been fully immersed in the migration towards a modern, event-driven microservices ecosystem. Here I have further strengthened this hybrid profile — combining functional leadership with architectural design and hands-on development — aligning teams and ensuring the platform evolves at the pace and scale the business demands.

What defines me today is precisely that mix: a backend engineer by background, but above all an enabler — someone who connects technology and functionality, empowers teams, and drives projects forward with the conviction that real value comes from building both robust systems and the bridges that make them meaningful.

### Beyond Work

Outside of work, I’m passionate about strength training — pushing my limits, planning my progress, and becoming stronger every day. I love exploring nature, take joy in reading and learning new things, and value the time I spend with my loved ones. These passions keep me balanced and reflect the same mindset I bring to my career: discipline, curiosity, and a drive to evolve.
