## About Me

I’m a software engineer at Imatia Innovation, working with Inditex on large-scale inventory management platform. My focus today is on backend development and microservices with Java, Spring Boot, and Kafka, while leading my team from a strong functional perspective. What defines me is being a hybrid profile: I bridge business requirements with technology, enabling teams and ensuring projects deliver real value.

### My Journey

Since I was a teenager, I knew I wanted to become a computer engineer. My degree at the University of A Coruña confirmed that decision and led me to explore the world of low-level programming and embedded systems, a focus I captured in my Bachelor’s thesis *“Energy Consumption Modeling for the Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 Processor”*. Shortly after, at Telecon Galicia, I worked on embedded software for energy management devices, and it was there — almost by chance — that I first had to design a high-level backend platform using Python and Django. What began as necessity quickly turned into a genuine interest. Later, at Bionix Technologies, I deepened this path by focusing on RFID platforms, directly tied to my Master’s thesis *“Inventory Traceability and Verification Across the Supply Chain Using RFID”*.

In 2020 I joined Imatia Innovation to work with Inditex, and it was here that my career truly took shape. I started with the company’s inventory centralization platform, a monolithic system built with Java, IBM MQ, WebSphere, MongoDB and DB2. Within months I stepped up as proxy tech lead, coordinating the development team and guiding the service both technically and functionally. This experience marked the beginning of my transition from being “just” a developer to becoming someone who also bridges business requirements with engineering execution.

Since 2023 I have been fully immersed in the migration to modern microservices, where Kafka is at the heart of the architecture, alongside Spring Boot, Java 17+, Hexagonal Architecture, MongoDB, Couchbase and OpenShift, with Grafana ensuring observability. In this environment I’ve grown into a hybrid role: technical enough to understand the architecture, but above all focused on functional leadership, aligning teams and helping the platform evolve at the pace and scale the business demands.

What defines me today is precisely that mix: a backend engineer by background, but above all an enabler — someone who connects technology and functionality, empowers teams, and drives projects forward with the conviction that real value comes from building both robust systems and the bridges that make them meaningful.

### Beyond Work

Outside of work, I’m passionate about strength training — pushing my limits, planning my progress, and becoming stronger every day. I love exploring nature, take joy in reading and learning new things, and value the time I spend with my loved ones. These passions keep me balanced and reflect the same mindset I bring to my career: discipline, curiosity, and a drive to evolve.
