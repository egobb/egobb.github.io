This is the first post of the new **dark minimalist** blog.

- Built on Jekyll + Minimal Mistakes (remote theme).
- Styled with a custom dark skin and light typography.
- Ships with pagination, SEO, sitemap and RSS by default.

Next steps:
1. Tweak the accent color.
2. Publish short notes about your portfolio work-in-progress.
3. Add a _/now_ page or a roadmap if you like.
